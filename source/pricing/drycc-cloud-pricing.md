## Drycc Cloud Pricing

> Access the most powerful Container as a Service (CaaS) as a fully managed service.

### Why pay for what you don’t use?

With a transparent usage-based pricing model, Drycc Cloud users are charged only on the work performed. Users no longer have to engage in capacity planning to allocate or size a server as a prerequisite for running workloads. Backed by a platform that elastically scales as your workloads increase or contract, usage-based pricing saves you from overpaying for over-provisioned managed services costs or facing outages or service degradations due to underprovisioning.

### Drycc Cloud Offerings
